# midjourney-image-splitter
The image generation software "Midjourney" often returns 4 small images stitched together to one larger image. Since I needed to process a lot of such pictures, I needed a software that automatically cuts them into 4 separate images. This software does that.
For example this image:

Is split into four images like this:
